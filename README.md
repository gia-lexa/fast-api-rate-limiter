# FastAPI Rate-Limited Public API

## Overview
This project is a **FastAPI-based public API** that implements **rate limiting** using Redis. The goal is to prevent excessive API usage by enforcing request limits per user/IP within a specified time window. This ensures fair usage and prevents abuse.

## Why This Project?
This API is being built to provide **public access to a set of endpoints** while maintaining **stability and security**. Public APIs are often targeted by scrapers, bots, or excessive requests from users, which can degrade performance. Implementing rate limiting and authentication ensures that resources are **fairly distributed**, protects against **DDoS attacks**, and encourages **responsible API consumption**.

## Current Features
- **FastAPI-based API:** A lightweight, high-performance backend.
- **Redis-based Rate Limiting:** Limits requests per IP using a **fixed window** approach.
- **Configurable Rate Limits:** Set a maximum number of requests per time window (e.g., **100 requests per 10 minutes**).
- **Middleware Implementation:** Rate limiting is enforced through FastAPIâ€™s middleware.
- **HTTP 429 Too Many Requests:** Users exceeding the limit receive an appropriate error response.

## Upcoming Features
To make this API **more robust and production-ready**, the following enhancements are planned:

### 1. JWT-Based Authentication
- Implement authentication via **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**.
- Allow **authenticated users** to have different rate limits compared to anonymous users.
- Secure endpoints using **OAuth2 password flow** with JWT.

### 2. Custom Rate Limits per User Type
- Implement different rate limits for:
  - **Anonymous users:** **100 requests per 10 minutes**.
  - **Authenticated users:** **500 requests per 10 minutes**.
  - **Premium users:** **Higher or unlimited requests**.
- Modify the rate limiter middleware to check **user roles** and apply appropriate limits.

### 3. Enhanced Security Measures
- Implement **IP whitelisting** for internal use cases.
- Introduce **blacklisting** for abusive clients exceeding limits repeatedly.

### 4. Deployment and Scalability
- **Dockerize** the application for easy deployment.
- Deploy using **AWS, GCP, or Azure**.
- Integrate a **reverse proxy (NGINX, Traefik)** for additional rate limiting at the network level.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Redis Server
- FastAPI & Uvicorn

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-rate-limit-api.git
cd fastapi-rate-limit-api
```

#### 2. Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Run Redis server (if not already running):
```sh
redis-server
```

#### 4. Start the FastAPI server:
```sh
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

#### 5. Test the API:
- Open your browser and visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Use tools like Postman or `curl` to send requests.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **GET** | `/public` | Publicly accessible endpoint |
| **GET** | `/protected` | Requires JWT authentication |
| **GET** | `/rate-limited` | Example endpoint with enforced rate limits |
| **POST** | `/token` | Generate JWT token for authentication |

---

## Authentication

Once JWT authentication is implemented, users will need to:
1. **Register/Login** to receive a JWT token.
2. **Include the JWT token** in the `Authorization` header (`Bearer <token>`).
3. **Receive different rate limits** based on their authentication level.
